abstract="Navigating safely and efficiently in complex and crowded scenarios is a challenging problem of practical significance. A realistic and cluttered environmental layout usually significantly impacts crowd distribution and robotic motion decision-making during crowded navigation. However, previous methods almost either learn and evaluate navigation strategies in unrealistic barrier-free settings or assume that expensive features like pedestrian speed are available. Although accurately measuring pedestrian speed in large-scale scenarios is itself a difficult problem. To fully investigate the impact of static environment layouts on crowded navigation and alleviate the reliance of robots on costly features, we propose a novel crowded navigation framework with Human-Environment-Robot (HERO) ternary fusion named CrowdNav-HERO. Specifically, (i) a simulator that integrates an agent, a variable number of pedestrians, and a series of realistic environments is customized to train and evaluate crowded navigation strategies. (ii) Then, a pedestrian trajectory prediction module is introduced to eliminate the dependence of navigation strategies on pedestrian speed features. (iii) Finally, a novel crowded navigation strategy is designed by combining the pedestrian trajectory predictor and a layout feature extractor. Convincing comparative analysis and sufficient benchmark tests demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of success rate, collision rate, and cumulative rewards.
